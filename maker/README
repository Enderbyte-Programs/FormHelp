This folder should not be included in final builds. It contains the maker.py file which helps you make help files

===== Setting up environment =====

ON WINDOWS

- If you have not already, download Python 3.11.x from https://www.python.org
- The reason 3.11 is needed is because a very needed library does not work with 3.12
- Install the python you just installed. Make sure that the "Add Python to PATH" is checked.
- Run `py -m pip install windows-curses cursesplus markdown2 enderbyteprograms` on the command line
- If the above command says "py is not found," reboot your computer.

ON LINUX

- Your Linux Distro should already come with Python installed.
- Make sure you have the python3-pip package installed (or python-pip if on ARCH).
- Run the following command: `pip3 install cursesplus markdown2 enderbyteprograms`

===== You are now ready to go =====
